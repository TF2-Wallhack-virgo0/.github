## 💡 What Is a Wallhack in TF2?

A **Wallhack** is a visual cheat that overlays **player and object outlines** through walls, props, doors, and map geometry. It shows enemies’ positions, class, HP, distance, and even buildings like Sentries and Dispensers.

Paired with aimbot or triggerbot, it creates the ultimate **pre-fire, pre-positioning, and awareness advantage**. It’s like playing with x-ray vision 🧠
